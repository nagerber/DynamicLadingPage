# Landing Page Project
This is a Project I worked on for the the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
It requires to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically 
updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
In this project i manly worked on the js file, there were only small adaptations on the css and html files.

## Summary (by Udacity)
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.
